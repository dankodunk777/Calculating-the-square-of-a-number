Here's an example of a Python script that calculates the square of a number:

```python
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
square = number ** 2
print("The square of", number, "is", square)
```

And here's an example of JavaScript code that calculates the square of a number:

```javascript
let number = parseFloat(prompt("Enter a number: "));
let square = number ** 2;
console.log("The square of", number, "is", square);
```

Both examples prompt the user to enter a number, calculate its square, and then display the result.
